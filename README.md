# 42_Cub3D

***My first RayCaster with minilibX***

This project is inspired by the world-famous Wolfenstein 3D game, which
was the first FPS ever. It will enable you to explore ray-casting. Your goal will be to
make a dynamic view inside a maze, in which you’ll have to find your way.

## TODO

- Collision travers murs (pas de collision)
- Quitter la fenetre avec la croix == SIGSEV
- Parsing map / error message
- Lissage des textures (crenelages, distance, ...)
